# Intro

This is private development repository of the "kind'a platformer", "cut-the-rope-like" physics based 2d cartoon-painted graphics unity project. Here, we commit our changes to code, develop new features, do coding stuff.
This repository must not be shared with public community, except of trusted people (like testers (highly trusted testers)). 

# Description

The motif of the game is an adventure, in which you try to complete various levels using your logic, items, and abilities. As much as possible ingame objects should have as much physics properties as they could have. Ropes, heavy objects, arcs, wheels, lasers and ice, electricity, whatever. You try to change environment in such a way, that you can pass through. Game contains different places, and depending on these, you meet new physics stuff. For example, lasers and electricity can only be found in lab, or wooden stuff can only be met in forest, or ropes are frequently seen in jungles. Some of assets can be collected, and then crafted, and equipped (for instace, laser guns crafted from lasers, or jetpack, based on fans you can find in lab, or hooks, based on ropes).

Graphics part is mostly cartoon based. We'll try to create cartoonish, kind style graphics.

Sound part is not really defind jet, but we know that our goal is to make it feel kind and enjoyable.

Main character - we don't really know. It can be some imaginary monster, or human, or animal, whatever. We will choose appropriate style in process.

# Plan

1. Create as much physics assets as we can, to use them in level design later.
2. Design specific game atmosphere (levels). For each place, cerate game-specific level background. Maybe design map ambience for each place.
3. Add appropriate design to every physics asset in game.
4. Implement character movement, controlling, additional features (maybe some abilities, inventory system). Don't forget - character also should have physics properties! (if it gets punched, for instance,  by anvil - it certainly should die (or at least get hurt), right?)
5. UI part - add menus, shops, lobby, inventory system, account management.
6. Vault systems, shop (logic).
6. Databases - database for accounts, database for special offers, etc...
7. Link it all together: Link UI menus and define functionality for buttons, make UI components interact with game, link database to the game.
8. Add donations and adds.
